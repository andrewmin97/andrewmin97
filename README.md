### Hi! I'm Andrew and welcome to my github ðŸ‘‹

Here, you'll find past projects I've worked on, as well as basic implementations created in the process of learning and getting used to new technology!

You might have noticed that I made a decent number of contributions in the past year...Unfortunately, that's all private work that I can't share, so I must say I'm sorry you won't find much on my page.

At least you got to see an image of an ape in a space suit! 

Have a bug-free day!
